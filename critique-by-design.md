#  Critique by Design

## Step one: Find a data visualization

I found the data visualization from the world bank organization’s official website. The organization's main goal is to reduce poverty and promote sustainable economic growth in the poorest countries of the world. They covered programs cover a wide range of areas, including agriculture, education, energy, health, and infrastructure development. I found the brief named ”Food Prices for Nutrition DataHub: global statistics on the cost and affordability of healthy diets“, which highlights there is a huge group of people who cannot afford a healthy diet in the world. The visualization’s story cannot illustrate the purpose and mislead the audience. I decided to use two visualizations to improve it.
