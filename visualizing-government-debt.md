## Part 2: Working with Flourish
### General Government Debt Grid of Line Charts 

I used the flourish.studio to visualize the country debtâ€™s data following the instructions. I visualized it by a grid of sparklines charts, in which each country is divided into one-line charts and tracks the debt-to-GDP ratio across time. Some countries' line does not start from 1995, because there is no available data in that time period. I added an intuitive title, so the audience can easily understand the graphs representing the years of the data. I also attached the source at the end.

### Japan Debt Threat

To narrow down the debt issue, I focused on the Japan's government debt, which is the highest in the given data. (Due to there is no provided key for Tableau and my free trail was used up last semaster, I still use Flourish to generate more practice.)
