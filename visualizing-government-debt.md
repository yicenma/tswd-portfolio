## Part 2: Working with Flourish
### General Government Debt Sparkline 

I used the flourish.studio to visualize the country debtâ€™s data following the instructions. I visualized it by a grid of sparklines charts, in which each country is divided into one-line charts and tracks the debt-to-GDP ratio across time. Some countries' line does not start from 1995, because there is no available data in that time period. I added an intuitive title, so the audience can easily understand the graphs representing the years of the data. I also attached the source at the end.
