| Questions               | Interview 1 (Mid 20s, Female) | Interview 2 (Mid 20s, Male) | Interview 3 (Mid 20s, Female) |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Q1                      |I think the students at CMU could be the audience for this wireframe.  |Yes, college students.              |             |
| Q2                      |We could utilize the time we wasted on social media and other internet contents to do more meaningful things and develop good habits that can make us healthier.                                |The bad habits we developed are harming our health. We always find excuses to not exercise and eat healthy diets. We could save time from gaming and social media.              |             |
| Q3                      |I think this is impressive. The donut shape graph used too many different colors. I suggest using fewer colors and make everything uniform. |Yes. The numbers are shocking, and the use of images is accurate and precise.              |             |
| Q4                      |No. I think everything is clear and straightforward.   |Yes. I think you need a transition from students being overwhelmed and feeling stressed to having bad habits. Some logic is missing there.             |             |
| Q5                      |I would say the use of color. I think you currently have too many colors, try to find a few main colors you want to use. Also, for the graph showing how many minutes people spend on social media in a day. I think you can show how much time they spend in a year and highlight it.                                |What is your source for "How can I find time to work out while going to CMU?" and "As a master's program student, I don't get time for exercise". It can be more convincing if you can list the source just like what you did for the Oregon State University's study.             |             |
| Q6                      |Yes. These charts are very illustrative.                                |Yes. These charts are self-explanatory and contain useful information.             |             |
| Q7                      |Yes, it motivated me to exercise more. I have been physically inactive for the past. I want to be healthier.                                |Yes. I felt Iâ€™m always the one trying to find excuses to not eat healthy and to not exercise. When my parents ask, I always say no time, but in reality, I spent a lot of time on games             |             |
