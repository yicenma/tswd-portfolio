# Wireframes / storyboards

# User research 

## Target audience
The audience of my website are college students. I'm trying to promote good habits such as exercising, eating healthy food, and getting enough sleep, which many students declare they don’t have time to do it. However, students often waste too much time on social media and use "no time" as an excuse for their bad habits. This phenomenon is prominent in college.

## Interview script

The goal of the interview is to gather some suggestions for the future modification of the story board and visualizations from the interviewees. Also, to make sure the story telling is impressive and easy to understand for the audience.

> I interview three people. Two are 20’s female students and one is 20’s male master student.


| Questions               | Interview 1 (Mid 20s, Female) | Interview 2 (Mid 20s, Male) | Interview 3 (Mid 20s, Female) |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Q1                      |I think the students at CMU could be the audience for this wireframe.  |Yes, college students.              |People who are college students and those who need exercise              |
| Q2                      |We could utilize the time we wasted on social media and other internet contents to do more meaningful things and develop good habits that can make us healthier.                                |The bad habits we developed are harming our health. We always find excuses to not exercise and eat healthy diets. We could save time from gaming and social media.              |I need to trade of between my screen time and exercise time             |
| Q3                      |I think this is impressive. The donut shape graph used too many different colors. I suggest using fewer colors and make everything uniform. |Yes. The numbers are shocking, and the use of images is accurate and precise.              |I think the story on page 7 is a little bit redundant: I think since you already empathize the time spend used highlighted percentage; another diagram is a little bit redundant.             |
| Q4                      |No. I think everything is clear and straightforward.   |Yes. I think you need a transition from students being overwhelmed and feeling stressed to having bad habits. Some logic is missing there.             |I know you emphasize the trade off on page 7-8 because we shared our story once, but I think a little bit explanation would be clear for those who only get the access to view the story.               |
| Q5                      |I would say the use of color. I think you currently have too many colors, try to find a few main colors you want to use. Also, for the graph showing how many minutes people spend on social media in a day. I think you can show how much time they spend in a year and highlight it.                                |What is your source for "How can I find time to work out while going to CMU?" and "As a master's program student, I don't get time for exercise". It can be more convincing if you can list the source just like what you did for the Oregon State University's study.             |I think you can add a little bit explanation of page 7-8 to make a transition.              |
| Q6                      |Yes. These charts are very illustrative.                                |Yes. These charts are self-explanatory and contain useful information.             |Yes. The line competition is super clear for us to know which social media is the most popular one             |
| Q7                      |Yes, it motivated me to exercise more. I have been physically inactive for the past. I want to be healthier.                                |Yes. I felt I’m always the one trying to find excuses to not eat healthy and to not exercise. When my parents ask, I always say no time, but in reality, I spent a lot of time on games             |Yes. Because the bad habit in the end helps me successfully identify the bad habit I have and motived me to make such tradeoff between social media and exercise time.             |
