# Changes made since Part II
> Include few paragraphs that reflects on changes you made since the completion of Part II. 

Firstly, based on part2’s interview findings, I revised my story by removing some redudents graphs, adding some transitions, and grammar check and highlighting some important messages to the audience. 

Furthermore, I reviewed the professor’s comments on the part II and revise those. For example, I added all of my reference in MLA format and the footnote in my story. Moreover, I tried a couple of visualization for my donuts charts and decided to use the pie chart and highlight the social media changes as the final result. Moreover, I also finalize all my visualizations. And I asked my friend’s suggestion on improvements and revise them again. 
All of the works are listed as below:

- Finalize all the visualization, ex. adding the data source as the footnote, complete title, x-axis and y-axis, ect.
- Add the two transitions page to smooth my story flow
- Change the title color to make it easier to read
- Remove one redundant chart
- Re-design the donut shape visualizations
- Provide all the references for data and image
- Change the background to make the story more emotional
- Change the time to scale of lifespan to highlight the waste of time on social media
- Add one page to shift focus to college student
- Add more words to explain/make it easy to understand
- Reorder the order of the pages
- Change the color of the button close to the above images 
- Highlight some important words in colors
- Grammar check


## The audience
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.

The audience of my website is college students. I'm trying to promote good habits such as exercising, eating healthy food, and getting enough sleep, which many students declare they don’t have time to do it. However, students often waste too much time on social media and use "no time" as an excuse for their bad habits. This phenomenon is prominent in college. I want to story the story because I benefited from these good habits. I want to educate these people to save social media time and shift to healthy habits to benefit themselves.

## Final design decisions
> You can specifically break out your design decisions here, or include it under *Changes made since Part II* and delete this section. Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.  Include any other information that helps round out your data story. 

In the first part design, I only decided to motivate the United States people to do physical activity, because this is what I am currently doing. But in fact, the topic is broad and too general. So, I decided to narrow down my topics to a more relevant topic as a college student. The topic of the unhealthy habits of college students might be less commonly discussed compared to the general health issues of the US. 

So, the topic could be a refreshing and interesting perspective for your audience. Moreover, my personal experience to shift unhealthy habits to healthy lifestyles makes it easier for you to provide insights and recommendations. So, discussing this topic might be more authentic and compelling for your audience. Ultimately, in my call to action, I provided the actions which are actionable and more concrete steps, and easy to complete.

My story is supported by complete and accurate data, which makes my story convincing to my audience as well.

## References

All of my references are listed at the end of my story page.

# Final thoughts
> You can summarize any final thoughts / reflections that don't fit well in the previous sections here.  How did it go?  What did you run out of time for, or wish you had a chance to revisit?  What were you most excited about?  Include any final reflections as you think they might help us understand your process.  If you already included such reflections elsewhere, you can delete this section. 

In this project, it is hard for me to find a proper topic, because I want to illustrate the physical inactivity of people since this is what I’m doing right now and I actually benefited from daily exercises. However, my previous topic was too broad and it is difficult to attract an appropriate audience. Therefore, I narrowed down my audience and polished my topic three times. I also spent a lot of time looking for proper data to better convince my audience. I want to talk with facts and use data to make my visualization credible. Some data is really hard to find. If I get another chance, I should choose the right topic in stage one. I should spend more time discussing my topic selection with the professor and make it right the first time so that I can save a lot of time from the redundant work. In part three, I also spent a lot of time revising and polishing my story. I think the interview feedback and the advice from the professor help me a lot in revising and re-structure of my story flow. I think the final results turned out great and met my expectations.
